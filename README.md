# 💳 ATM Machine Simulator in Java

This is a **simple ATM machine simulation** project written in **Java** as part of my Java learning journey. The project demonstrates fundamental OOP concepts and allows users to perform banking operations like checking balance, withdrawing, and depositing money through a command-line interface.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ PIN authentication system  
- 💰 Check account balance  
- 💸 Withdraw amount (with insufficient balance check)  
- 💵 Deposit amount  
- 🔁 Menu-driven interface with recursive navigation  
- 🧠 Basic error handling for invalid input

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Java class & object creation  
- Scanner class for input  
- Conditional logic using `if-else`  
- Loops and method calls  
- Data encapsulation and class methods  
- Simple command-line menu system

---

## 🧾 Usage

1. Compile the code:
   ```
   javac Main.java
   ```
   
2. Run the program:
   ```
   java Main
   ```
   
3. Default PIN is 5678. Use it to access the menu.


## 📂 Project Structure

ATM-Machine : 

- Main.java           # Main class to run the ATM app
- ATM.java            # ATM logic: check balance, deposit, withdraw, etc.

## 📸 Output Sample
Enter Your PIN: 
5678
Enter your choice: 
1. Check Balance
2. Withdraw Amount
3. Deposit Amount
4. Exit



## 📚 Future Enhancements

1. Add real user authentication.
2. Store data persistently (e.g., using files or database).
3. Improve input validation.
4. Use GUI with JavaFX or Swing

##  🛠️ Developed While Learning
This project was created while learning Java fundamentals, OOP principles, and CLI-based application development.
